Step #1
function [3:0] get_seqcount_nonoverlapping;
endfunction

Complete the above function in the sequence detector test bench


Step #2
Update the drive_dut task
	-> get counts for both overlapping and nonoverlapping
	-> justify by combining the results of both counts to justify the output results

Step #3
Come up with a logic to print the percentage of test that passed
in a given simulation run. Write a function or task for realizing it
Try to log the results into a file
